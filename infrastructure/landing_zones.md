## Overview

Azure Landing Zones provide a structured approach to deploying workloads securely in Azure. They ensure governance, compliance, and security controls are enforced from the start.

### Key Benefits

- **Security at Scale:** Enforce security best practices across multiple environments.
- **Governance & Compliance:** Align with frameworks such as CIS, NIST, and ISO 27001 using official Microsoft guidance.
- **Identity & Access Management:** Implement least privilege access with Azure AD, following Microsoft's best practices.

## Landing Zones for AI Solutions

- **Leverage Proven Architecture Designs:**
  - Microsoft offers several well-documented architecture designs for AI solutions. For example, refer to the [Basic OpenAI End-to-End Chat Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/architecture/basic-openai-e2e-chat) as a comprehensive guide for deploying AI workloads securely within Landing Zones.
