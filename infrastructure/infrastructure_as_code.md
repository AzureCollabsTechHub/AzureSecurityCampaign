# Azure Security Campaign: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for Secure AI Deployments

Last updated: 2025-02-28

---

## Overview

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) enables automated, consistent, and secure deployment of Azure resourcesâ€”crucial for deploying and managing secure infrastructures that support AI workloads.

### Key Benefits

- **Consistency:** Deploy identical, secure environments across multiple regions or subscriptions.
- **Security:** Embed security controls (e.g., NSGs, identity configurations, encryption) directly in your deployment scripts.
- **Automation:** Accelerate deployments and reduce human error with repeatable, automated processes.

<!-- REMINDER: Add a diagram or flowchart illustrating an IaC pipeline for AI workloads -->

## Implementation

For a step-by-step guide on using IaC for secure deployments, refer to these official Microsoft resources:

- [Azure Resource Manager Templates Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview)
- [Bicep Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/)
- [Terraform on Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/)

<!-- REMINDER: Insert images or screenshots of sample IaC scripts and deployment pipelines -->

## Security Considerations

- **Embedded Security Controls:** Incorporate network security, identity, and encryption settings directly in your IaC scripts.
- **Version Control:** Manage IaC scripts in source control for tracking changes and enforcing code reviews.
- **Compliance as Code:** Utilize automated policy checks and audits to ensure all deployments adhere to security standards.

<!-- REMINDER: Include examples of policy definitions or compliance dashboards if available -->
